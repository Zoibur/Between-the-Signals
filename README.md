Set in a fictional world during the climax of war between two nations. You're tasked with the roll of receiving enemy signals, decoding them, and sending forwarding the messages back home. Beware, there are risks that come with being a spy in the heart of your enemies' main city where they regularly patrol. Confined in a small bedroom, your decoding skills will decide the fate of thousands.

Will you succeed or will you fail?
